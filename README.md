# Dijkstra-Pathfinding-Visualizer
A web-based application that instantly computes and displays the shortest path between two nodes using Dijkstra’s algorithm. Users can interactively design a grid, define start and end points, and place obstacles to observe how the algorithm finds the optimal route.
